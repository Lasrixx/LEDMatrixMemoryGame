# LEDMatrixMemoryGame
Small Arduino project that uses the MAX7219 LED Dot Matrix and Analog Joystick components to create a simple sequence recall game. The LED matrix displays a random combination of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' (indicating the directions to press the joystick towards). The aim of the game is repeat the sequence displayed using the joystick. If you get the sequence correct, a thumbs up icon is displayed on the matrix and the a new sequence (this time one step longer) is displayed. This continues until the user gets a sequence wrong and the game resets.
